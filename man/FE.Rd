\arguments{
\item{CC}{Three-dimensional matrix, where each submatrix along the z-axis is a square and
reflective incidence matrix, or a list of data.frames containing square and reflective
incidence matrices. Each matrix represents a complete graph.}

\item{CE}{Three-dimensional matrix, where each submatrix along the z-axis is a rectangular
incidence matrix, or a list of data.frames containing rectangular incidence matrices.
Each matrix represents a bipartite graph.}

\item{EE}{Three-dimensional matrix, where each submatrix along the z-axis is a square
and reflective incidence matrix, or a list of data.frames containing square and reflective
incidence matrices. Each matrix represents a complete graph.}

\item{mode}{Mode: Specify the mode for the FE function. If the mode is set to 'Per-Expert,'
the function will calculate using all experts. If the mode is set to 'Bootstrap,' the function will utilize this method.}

\item{thr}{Real between [0,1]: Defines the degree of truth for which the incidence
is considered significant. By default thr = 0.5.}

\item{maxOrder}{Positive integer greater than 1: Defines the maximum order
of the forgotten effects. By default maxOrder = 2.}

\item{reps}{The number of bootstrap replicas. By default reps = 10.000.}

\item{parallel}{The type of parallel operation to use (if applicable).
The options are "multicore", "snow" and "no". By default parallel = "no".}

\item{ncpus}{Integer: Number of processes that will be used in the parallel
implementation. By default ncpus = 1.}
}
\value{
The function returns a list with subsets of data.
$boot: List of data.frame for each of the generated commands, contains the following components:
\item{From}{Indicates the origin of the forgotten effects relationships.}
\item{Through_x}{Dynamic field representing the intermediate relationships of the forgotten effects.
For example, for order n there will be "Through_1" up to "Through_ <n-1>" \eqn{Through_(n-1)}.}
\item{To}{Indicates the end of the forgotten effects relationships.}
\item{Count}{Number of times the forgotten effect was repeated.}
\item{Mean}{Mean effect of the forgotten effect.}
\item{LCI}{Lower Confidence Intervals.}
\item{UCI}{Upper Confidence Intervals.}
\item{SE}{Standard error.}

$byExperts: List of data.frames for each of the generated orders that contains the incidence
values for each of the relationships found by the expert, the components are:
\item{From}{Indicates the origin of the forgotten effects relationships.}
\item{Through_x}{Dynamic field representing the intermediate relationships of the forgotten effects.
For example, for order n there will be "Through_1" up to "Through_ <n-1>".}
\item{To}{Indicates the end of the forgotten effects relationships.}
\item{Count}{Number of times the forgotten effect was repeated.}
\item{Expert_x}{Dynamic field that represent each of the entered experts.}

\description{
Performs the forgotten effects calculation proposed by Kaufman and Gil-Aluja (1988)
 with multiple experts. The parameters allow you to specify the significant degree of truth and
 the order of incidence that is required to be calculated for chained bipartite graphs.
  The function returns the frequency of appearance of the forgotten effect, its mean incidence,
   the confidence intervals and the standard error in each order.
}
\details{
The function extends the theory of forgotten effects proposed by Kaufmann and Gil-Aluja (1988),
 to find indirect cause-effect relationships from direct cause-effect relationships, in the
 case of multiple experts.
The parallel and ncpus options are not available on Windows operating systems.

\examples{
# example code
# To chain bipartite graphs the parameters CC, CE and EE are used.
FE(CC = CC, CE = CE, EE = EE, mode = "Per-Expert", thr = 0.5, maxOrder = 2, reps = 100)
# To complete graphs you will need to use two dataset, for example
FE(CC = CC, CE = CE, EE = NULL, mode = "Per-Expert", thr = 0.5, maxOrder = 2, reps = 100)
